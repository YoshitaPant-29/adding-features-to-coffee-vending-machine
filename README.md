# coffee-vending-machine with Verification plans
📌 Overview

This project implements a Coffee Vending Machine in Verilog with verification using a self-checking testbench.
It supports multiple payment scenarios, refund on timeout, and resource availability checks (like milk).
The design demonstrates FSM (Finite State Machine) based hardware design, assertions, and test-driven verification.

⚙️ Features

✅ FSM-based coffee machine controller
✅ Accepts coins and validates payments
✅ Refunds extra coins or on timeout
✅ Handles back-to-back orders
✅ Resource check (milk availability)
✅ Assertions for safety checks
